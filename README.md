### About

MetaMultiSKAT provides a meta-analysis framework for performing rare-variant based tests of associations with multiple phenotypes across multiple studies. It is a kernel regression framework extension of [MultiSKAT](https://github.com/diptavo/MultiSKAT). This is an initial working version. A number of functionalities will be added soon.


### MetaMultiSKAT v(1.0)

This package contains the R-codes/functions (including an example dataset) to carry out the MetaMultiSKAT tests. The package is still under developement. Any questions or bug-reports should be mailed to diptavo@umich.edu
